# MY-CMPG212-Creative-Project
Individual Assessment Completed from last year's module CMPG 212 to demonstrate how well I can integrated concepts I learned from the module. In short scenario states that; a lecturer from the North-West University needs to group different students from all three campuses of the NWU. As a result I created a C# ASP.NET Web Application.

##HOW IT IMPACTED MY CAREER:
The source code from this project had an impact on my software development career in such a way that it enhanced my user experience and helped me gain insight on how to build more friendly application. Again, it showcased my technical skills by revieling my potential to create web applications that can be hosted on the internet using Cookies and Sessions. Last but not least it showed me that theres room for improvement as I was able to come up with a scenario of my own and be able to successfully solve the problem outlined in the scenario by developing a C# ASP.NET Web Application.

###PROJECT SCENARIO IS AS FOLLOWS(including, Problem Solving Approach):
A lecturer from the North-West University needs to group different students from all three campuses of the NWU. The web application will be 
use cookies, session and validation as descibed below:
   Program for grouping students from three campuses(Vanderbjilpark, Potchestroom and Mahikeng) into three groups according to group color
   Blue, Red and/or Green. 
   The user/Lecturer will be able to log in, and the log-in details are to be stored in cookies. Should also be able
   to add and delete students. 
   Session will be applied in the program to filter/search for students using their group color, to see students in group Blue and etc.
   And cookies will be used to store details of students to be added and log-in details. 
   Button(Back) and hyperlinks are in use for moving from one page to another.
   Validation is also used for surname and email inputs. In the website, validation is not used for the search and delete
   textboxes.
