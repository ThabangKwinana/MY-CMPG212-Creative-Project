# MY-CMPG212-Creative-Project
Individual Assessment Completed from last year's module CMPG 212 to demonstrate how well I can integrated concepts I learned from the module. In short scenario states that; a lecturer from the North-West University needs to group different students from all three campuses of the NWU. As a result I created a C# ASP.NET Web Application.
